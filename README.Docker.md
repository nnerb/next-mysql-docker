# Docker Setup for Next.js with Prisma and MySQL

This document guides you through the process of setting up the Docker environment for running your **Next.js** application with **Prisma** as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) and a **MySQL** database.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- **Docker**: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- **Docker Compose**: Comes bundled with Docker Desktop, or can be installed separately.

## Setting Up the Docker Environment

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone your project repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Configuration Files
Ensure you have the following configuration files in the root of your project:

- Dockerfile: Defines how the Next.js app is built
- compose.yaml: Defines the services (Next.js, MySQL) for Docker Compose.

#### Database Configuration for Dockerized Application

This document explains the differences between two common database connection configurations used in a Dockerized environment for MySQL.

##### 1. Using `localhost:3307` (for local environments)
```ini
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}@localhost:3307/${MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME}
```
- Usage: This configuration is used when running Prisma and the database locally on your machine.
- Use Case:  In this case, localhost refers to your local machine (host), and Prisma connects to the database running locally on port 3307. This setup is suitable for local development or testing, where Prisma needs to access a MySQL database running outside of Docker.  

##### 2. Using `mysqlhost:3306` (for Dockerized environments)
```ini
DOCKER_DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}@mysql:3306/${MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME}
```
- Usage: This configuration is used when both your app and database are running inside Docker containers.
- Explanation: When the app and database are running in separate Docker containers, mysql refers to the service name of the MySQL container in the Docker Compose file. Docker uses internal networking to resolve service names, so mysql connects to the MySQL database container running on port 3306. This setup ensures that Prisma can connect to the database running inside a Docker container.


### 3. Build and run the Docker container:
```bash
docker compose up
```
This command does the following:

1. Builds the Docker images based on the Dockerfile.
2. Starts the containers for the Next.js app and MySQL database.

### 4. Verify the Containers are Running

To check if the containers are up and running, use:

```bash
docker ps
```
You should see both the Next.js and MySQL containers listed.

### 5. Access the Application
Once the containers are running, open your browser and navigate to:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app in action.

### 6. Interact with the MySQL Database
To access MySQL, you can connect using a MySQL client or through the Docker container.

Access via Command Line
To connect to the MySQL container, use:
```bash
docker exec -it <mysql-container-name> mysql -u root -p
```
Access via Prisma Studio

If you are using Prisma for database management, you can use Prisma Studio to interact with your MySQL database through a GUI. First, make sure your Docker container is running, and then use the following command:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```
This will open Prisma Studio in your browser, allowing you to manage the database visually, view records, update data, and perform other database operations.

### 7. Stopping the Containers
To stop the containers, run:
```bash
docker compose down
```

To remove the containers and the associated volumes (e.g., MySQL data), run:
```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### 8. Troubleshooting
- Error: Port already in use: If you encounter this issue, ensure no other services are using the default MySQL or Next.js ports (3000 and 3306). You can change the ports in docker-compose.yml if needed.

- Database connection issues: Make sure the MySQL container is up and running before interacting with it.

- Prisma Studio not opening: If npx prisma studio does not open, ensure your containers are running and Prisma is properly configured in your project.
