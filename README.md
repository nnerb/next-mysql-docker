# Dockerized Next.js CRUD Todo App

This project is a CRUD Todo App built with modern web technologies, designed to be scalable and maintainable. The app is Dockerized for seamless deployment and uses MySQL for data persistence.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Next.js**: React framework with server-side rendering and API routes.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform used to package and run applications in isolated environments. It ensures consistency across multiple environments and helps with scalable deployments.
- **React Query**: For efficient server state management and API integration.
- **Prisma**: ORM for database modeling and type-safe queries.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for structured data storage.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances code reliability with strong typing.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Add, view, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with TailwindCSS for a clean and adaptable interface.
- **State Management**: Uses React Query for efficient fetching and mutation of data.
- **Database Integration**: MySQL and Prisma for a reliable database solution.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: The app is containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Node.js (v16 or newer)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm (any package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create the .env file:
Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables (you can use .env.example as a reference):
#### .env
```ini
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_mysql_root_password
MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME=your_db_name_here
```

#### Database Configuration for Dockerized Application

This document explains the differences between two common database connection configurations used in a Dockerized environment for MySQL.

1. Using `localhost:3307` (for local environments)
```ini
LOCAL_DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}@localhost:3307/${MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME}
```
- Usage: This configuration is used when running Prisma and the database locally on your machine.
- Use Case:  In this case, localhost refers to your local machine (host), and Prisma connects to the database running locally on port 3307. This setup is suitable for local development or testing, where Prisma needs to access a MySQL database running outside of Docker.  

2. Using `mysqlhost:3306` (for Dockerized environments)
```ini
DOCKER_DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}@mysql:3306/${MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME}
```
- Usage: This configuration is used when both your app and database are running inside Docker containers.
- Explanation: When the app and database are running in separate Docker containers, mysql refers to the service name of the MySQL container in the Docker Compose file. Docker uses internal networking to resolve service names, so mysql connects to the MySQL database container running on port 3306. This setup ensures that Prisma can connect to the database running inside a Docker container.

4. Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker compose up
```

5. Open your app in your browser:
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:300) to see the app in action.
