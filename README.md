# Dockerized Next.js CRUD Todo App

This project is a CRUD Todo App built with modern web technologies, designed to be scalable and maintainable. The app is Dockerized for seamless deployment and uses MySQL for data persistence.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Next.js**: React framework with server-side rendering and API routes.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform used to package and run applications in isolated environments. It ensures consistency across multiple environments and helps with scalable deployments.
- **React Query**: For efficient server state management and API integration.
- **Prisma**: ORM for database modeling and type-safe queries.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for structured data storage.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances code reliability with strong typing.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Add, view, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with TailwindCSS for a clean and adaptable interface.
- **State Management**: Uses React Query for efficient fetching and mutation of data.
- **Database Integration**: MySQL and Prisma for a reliable database solution.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: The app is containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Node.js (v16 or newer)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm (any package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create the .env file:
Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables (you can use .env.example as a reference):
#### .env
```ini
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_mysql_root_password
MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME=your_db_name_here
```

## Database Configuration for Dockerized Application

This document explains the differences between two common database connection configurations used in a Dockerized environment for MySQL.

### 1. Using `localhost:3307` (External Docker Network)
```ini
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}@localhost:3307/${MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME}
```
- Description: This configuration connects to the MySQL database running in Docker via the host machine (your local system) on port 3307.
- Use Case: This is used when the application is running outside Docker or when you need to connect to MySQL from a local tool like a database client.
- Important: This requires Docker to expose the MySQL container's internal port 3306 to the host machine's port 3307 via Docker port mapping (e.g., 3307:3306 in the docker-compose.yml).

### 2. Using `mysqlhost:3306` (Internal Docker Network)
```ini
DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}@mysql:3306/${MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME}
```
- Description: This configuration connects to the MySQL database using the internal Docker network. The mysql here refers to the service name defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
- Use Case: This is used when both the application and MySQL are running inside Docker in the same Docker network. The mysql service name acts as the hostname to connect to MySQL.
- Important: This does not require port mapping because Dockerâ€™s internal network allows communication between services using service names (e.g., mysql), which Docker resolves to the corresponding container.


4. Build and run the Docker container:

```bash
docker-compose up --build 
```

5. Open your app in your browser:
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:300) to see the app in action.
